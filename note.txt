If you have made these changes on your machine. (I'm assuming you have)

     1. Run a build of the DB package
     2. Run `npm pack` from the package's root folder.  This creates a .tgz zip file of your package with your custom modifications.
     3. Copy that file into the root (you could put it wherever but root makes things easy) of your project.
     4. In your `package.json` add the package `"bedybot-db": "file:bedybot-db-1.0.0.tgz"`, or replace the version number to the following 
               `"file:my-packed-file.tgz"`

     5. Run an npm install using your new package.json

you should have your modified copy loaded in as a dependency in node_modules.



npm pack --pack-destination=".\dist"
